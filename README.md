NetHack ported to the Web by Lu Wang

[Play Online](http://coolwanglu.github.io/BrowserHack/)

Most porting stuffs go to `win/web/*` and `web/*`.

Do NOT attempt to build this project unless you are ready to enter the endless abyss of PAIN.
Some found their pain is eased with `build.sh`, while some others said it brought more pain.

Only minimum features are supported while I'm rushing to make it work, but more features are coming.
Search for `TODO` in `win/web/*` and `web/*`.

Default tileset file is from http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Default_tileset_scaled_to_32x32

Need help for game testing, implementing more features and designing the interface.
