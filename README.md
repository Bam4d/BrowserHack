Most porting stuffs go to `win/web/*` and `web/*`.

To build the project, read and modify `build.sh` according to your environment, install dependencies, and use some good luck.

Only minimum features are supported while I'm rushing to make it work, but more features are coming.
Search for `TODO` in `win/web/*` and `web/*`.

Default tileset file is from http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Default_tileset_scaled_to_32x32

Need help for game testing, implementing more features and designing the interface.
